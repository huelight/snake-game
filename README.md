# Snake Game

![Snake Game Screenshot](snake_game_screenshot.png)

This is a simple Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The game replicates the classic Snake Xenzia game found on old Nokia phones. You control a snake that grows longer as it consumes food while avoiding collisions with itself and the game boundaries.

## How to Play

1. **Set Up the Game:**
   - Run the Python script `main.py`.
   - The game initializes with a snake and a piece of food.

2. **Controls:**
   - Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the direction of the snake.
   - The snake will continuously move in the chosen direction until it hits a wall or collides with itself.

3. **Game Objective:**
   - The goal is to consume as much food as possible to grow the snake longer.
   - The game ends if the snake collides with itself or hits the wall.

4. **High Score:**
   - The game keeps track of the highest score achieved.
   - The high score is saved in a `data.txt` file.

5. **Restarting the Game:**
   - After the game ends, press 'Space' to restart and try to beat your high score.

## How to Run

Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```
